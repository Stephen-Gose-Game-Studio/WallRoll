Wall-Roll is a strict time-based memory enhancing game for children in between the age group (6-12). The purpose behind making this game is to trigger memory cells by asking user to remember subsequent die results, which in turn strengthens the brain muscle. Crossword puzzles, learning a language, and memory games are among activities that help keep the brain in top shape.   

Basic overview of the working game:

1. The time limit for the die to remain on screen is 7-10s.
2. After the time is over, the die is not visible on screen and the number on the die that is seen last is asked.
3. As user advances, he/she has to remember all the previous results. The result of nth level demands the result of n, n-1, n-2, n-3…….n-(n-1) levels.
4. The user gets 3 lives.
5. After losing a life, Game continues from the level+1 at which the user died showing results of all the previous levels.
6. Score : +17 for passing each level.

For instance:

1. 1st roll : result 5  --- ( remember 5 ).
2. 2nd roll : result 6 ---(  remember 5,6 ).
3. 3rd roll : result 1 --- ( remember 5,6,1 ) and so on.
